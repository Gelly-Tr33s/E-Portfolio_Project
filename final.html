                    <div class="content">
                        <br>
                        <p> In Final Activity 1, we were tasked to install Laravel framework
                            in our computers. Laravel is a PHP framework that allows to build
                            web applications. With this framework, we can develop web applications
                            that can handle data rather than just a static website. Installing the framework
                            was quite challenging at first, but it makes me realize learning cmd and powershell can help a lot.
                            That is exactly what I did. I was able to successfully install Laravel afterwards.
                            As for the specifics: <br>
                            1. I downloaded Laragon as the deployment environment for the project <br> 
                            2. I downloaded Composer to manage the libraries needed for the project <br>
                            3. Using the composer, I installed Laravel <br>
                            4. Using Laragon, I made a project containing all the pre-built files needed for deployment <br>
                            5. Using my IDE, VSCode, I accessed the project then I ran it using "php artisan serve" </p> 
                            <p>Below is my work:</p>
                        <div class="images">
                            <img src="images/Torres_FinalAct1.png" alt="FinalAct1" width="700" height="400">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Final Activity 2 - Laravel Authentication</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <br>
                        <p> In Activity 2, we were tasked to create an account in our project. Using the project I made with
                            Laragon, I setup the database to be used for storing user credentials in the .env file. I used
                            MySQL Workbench as a database. Afterwards, I installed the Authentication Scaffolding through 
                            "composer require laravel/ui" and "php artisan ui bootstrap --auth" for the controllers, views, and routes.
                            Next, I installed the NPM dependencies "npm install" and "npm run dev" to compile the CSS and JS files.
                            To run the project, I typed "php artisan serve". <br> Once I run it, I saw the Register and Login button that enables
                            me to create an account and log in. With that, I made an account and logged in. I verified the account by checking the
                            database. I confirmed that the credentials are in the database and I concluded the activity. <br>
                            The activity was challenging because I was overwhelmed with amount of files at first, but I was able to do it
                            by learning the files for controllers, views, and routes.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <br>
                        <p> In Final Activity 3, we were tasked to create a CRUD functionality in our Laravel Projects.
                            To start, I setup a database in MySQL Workbench just like the previous activity. Afterwards, 
                            I created a controller and made CRUD methods inside it. Then I defined the routes and created views. 
                            Next, I tested the project and it was working. That concludes the process of final activity 3. <br>
                            With this activity, I became more familiar of the controllers, views, and routes, giving me a grasp of
                            web applications store data behind the scenes. <br>

                        <br>
                        <p> For our Final Project in Web Development, we are tasked to create a Task Management application using Laravel.
                            I contributed in the group as the requirements analyzer who identifies the functionality and roles needed for
                            the application as a guide for the developers. I also participated in making the wireframe for one of the roles in
                            as well as creating a front-end page for that role. <br>
                            I find it challenging since I alse needed to understand the code of the main assignee for front-end part of the app.
                            By managing my time and spending it towards learning the requirements, designs, and code, I was able to accomplish my
                            part in the group project. <br>
