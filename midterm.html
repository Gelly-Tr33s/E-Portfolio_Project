                        <p> In Activity 1, we were tasked to create simple 
                            pages describing three Philippine holidays using 
                            HTML text and images tags and attributes. I learned 
                            that these tags are the foundations of the content of 
                            a webpage. Without these tags, we may not be able 
                            to display our content in a webpage. </p>

                        <p> In Activity 2, we were tasked to create a webpage that contains 
                            three recipes along with their ingredients and procedures. 
                            All contents are placed in a tabular format. In this activity, 
                            I learned the uses of unordered lists and ordered lists. 
                            Unordered lists are good for listing items that do not need a 
                            specific order such as ingredients while ordered lists are 
                            useful for those that needed order such as procedures. </p>

                        <p> In Activity 3, we were tasked to create our own personal 
                            portfolio page using Bootstrap components such as Carousel, 
                            Grid, Table, and Card. The webpage contains my top 3 projects 
                            and achievements, my skills, my projects, and my education along with 
                            my degree, and years attended. I utilized different Bootstrap elements 
                            to create this webpage. Using Bootstrap makes coding much simpler for 
                            me. It makes me finish this webpage a lot faster 
                            but I still used CSS to make my own style.

                        <p> Activity 4 is a group activity, we were tasked to create a responsive restaurant website. 
                            It should contain a Home page, Menu page, Gallery page, About us page, and Contact page. 
                            In our group meeting, we were assigned create one webpage each. I was assigned to create a 
                            Contact page for the website. In this task, I typed in the our restaurant address (which is 
                            a fictional one), and a contact form that accepts Name, email, and message of users. 
                            I utilized to form tag and table tag to create an organized, visually appealing contact form.

                                We were tasked to design and develop static webpage for an event or conference, 
                                using HTML and CSS. The content of the webpage is all fictional and made-up. It contains the following:</p> 
                            <li>Header (or the navbar), Hero section to captivate audiences</li> 
                            <li>About section which contains information about the event</li> 
                            <li>Speakers section that has the profiles of speakers and brief description of their backgrounds</li> 
                            <li>Venue section that shows the address and a few pictures</li> 
                            <li>Schedule section with a condensed schedule of key events along with the slots</li> 
                            <li>Regristration section that has a "Register Now" button linking to a dummy registration form.</li> 
                            <li>Footer that contains the copyright information and contact information</li> 
                        </ul>    
                            <p>In the coding part of this activity, I utlized the Grid layout to organize the 
                                contents of each sections of a webpage and optimize it for better accesibility.
                                At first, using the grid layout was challenging to grasp how it works in my webpage.
                                But after hours of debugging I was able to use it effectively and make this webpage responsive.</p>

                        <p> Activity 6 is different from the rest of the activities. It focuses on JavaScript arithmetic operators. 
                            We were given four problem sets for us to solve using JS operators. This activity challenges our problem 
                            solving and mathematical skills, serving as an exercise to improve these skills.   </p>
